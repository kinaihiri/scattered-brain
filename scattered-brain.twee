#Hi

We're in the year 2020, which still sounds super future-y to me.

I figure I could try having my diary be interactive, so I can store the information my garbage brain forgets (all my lived experiences, opinions, and feelings) in a way that allows someone else to explore it non-linearly.

So, a kind lame labor-intensive neural net.

''Freewrite''

I think I have become, with age, a little better at feeling less like I do have an audience in my head. The voice of my partner, my brother, friends, all voices which moderate my writing and self-perception.

I've managed to selectively ignore those voices, I think, at the cost of coherence. I have to be in a certain mood to not make sense and write down my stray thoughts.

Writing on a computer feels...like it's not capturing my thoughts enough? I can type so fast that it almost feels pointless.

I have to get my thoughts down in time before they poof away.

I'm also a little scared. I have to, I feel, keep myself from getting in too deep in my own head. What if I do and I start believing in things that aren't real? There's a draw there. What if my own constructs are so alluring that I lose my mind? What if I go down the path where I become religious?

What if I don't remember how to listen to others?

What if relative objectivity slips away further?

But what if I am able to quiet the imagined voices of the people closes to me so I don't feel so judged all the time?

What if by letting myself be more myself, as odd and messy and all-over-the-place that is I can feel calmer?

What if I'm less weird than I want to be and I'm a disappointment to myself?

###Wednesday

Today,

* I tried to make a little sculpey monster that fell apart.
* Kept reading My Giant Nerd Boyfriend
* Wanted to die when coworkers oohed and aahed over project planning software
* Found out my Wu Tang Clan name is Illusional Illusionist (in the same meeting where I wanted to die)
	** (Brenda was Wacko Professional, which is very apt for her)
* Watched Detective Pikachu, a lazily-written movie that was saved by the giant Torterras and adorable Bulbasaurs
* I picked at my legs and it now hurts
* The artist I commissioned a bit-titty horned spider lady from got back to me with a sketch
* It was the kind of rainy where there's water floating everywhere you go. Not really pouring, just...droplets in your face as you walk.
* Apparently Paradise Lost is queer as fuck-- all-male angels fucking each other and C.S. Lewis was having none of it because he's booring. The person I read it from on Twitter has a Patreon where we talks about queer scholarship.
* I just want a fun niche like that.
* I need to learn how to drive.

###Saturday

I come up with a million topics when I'm not in front of my notebook.

I like Boston Dynamics robots, but I know how they will be used.

It's like I can't just enjoy any piece of technology anymore without being afraid of how it's going to deliberately hurt hundreds of thousands, millions of peoople.

The other day, I was enjoying a chat service instantly subtitling a conversation. Of course, I know this will be data thrown into a big pile to be used for machine learning or whatever to advertise more shit to me. Or something even worse.

Is this simply a result of knowing more, or is this something we can reverse? I would like to not sigh in exasperation and disappointment so often.

I do like my little tablet/laptop though.

###Monday

I slept a lot yesterday. Dreamed of a sea in the middle of a frozen tundra, with an ice spire in the middle. Sailed towards it.

I was a little thrown off after that. I also dreamed I was asking Sean what conditions would be favorable to have it happen in real life. The dream was pretty accurate as to how the actual conversation went.

<br>

Yesterday I asked Sean what his favorite videogame story was. He had, as usual, a lot of difficulty with the question.

What if I help him catalogue what he likes so it can be easier for him to recall this sort of stuff. Have him talk about feelings and preferences rather than concrete things.

"Okay, what story stayed with you even after you were done playing?" I had to narrow down what I meant by my question.

Apparently it was Metal Gear Solid, because of the discussion on nuclear bomb proliferation. For him, the sheer numbers were shocking at the age of 15 or soo--he had no idea beforehand, so it stayed with him.

I asked the Uglies (Rom and Mikhail):
* Rom said 999, named a couple of Phoenix Wright games. And Ghost Trick. DS very well-represented here.
* Mikhail said Firewatch due to the writing and the way the relationship developed. A good choice.

My answer? Sacrifice.

I think my brain is rebellious. I set goals and tell myself to do things and then my brain decides to //not// do those things.

''Notes about Anais Nin's writing''
* June is:
	** An empty box.
	** The reason to create?
	** Demonic indifference to human order
	** Lives by senses and intuitions
	** "She alone was without fetters"

* Henry is:
	** The worst (my opinion)
	** Inspiring ("arouses tremendous strength in me")
	** Does not love all of June

Ugh Henry Miller: "In the love between man and woman there is resistance and conflict. Two women do not judge each other, brutalize each other, or find anything to ridicule... such love is death, I'll admit."

Oh my goooooood shuuuut up Miller.

''Notes about the Critical Polyamorist''
######Intro, 10/23/2013
* Lots of white ppl. That was my experience too.
* "This isn't public journaling" why not?
* Applying critical social theory to polyamory communities in middle america.
* Cites Angela Wiley, "Science says she's gotta have it: reading for racial resonances in woman-centered poly literature"

######Paganism and Polyamory
* "Shared childlike wonder and fairytale romance" with either "an ancient magic in the earth itself" or Jesus/God (between paganism and Christianity)
* Pagans happen where atheism is a possibility, societies where belief in god/gods is //not// presumed
** Poaching in paganism of traditions
** Pagans construct faith in the face of rational secularism ("pretend")
** Sounds like Sean's mother, who believe trees can talk to her. I mean, I wish trees talked to me. But they don't. I don't think it's because I'm too busy or dead inside to listen... it'd be sad if that was the case, though.

At PAX, there was this dude talking about Isis and other female mythological figures to a game developer in a fancy costume that... I don't know, had elements that reminded him of those goddesses? That poor woman.]

"We are more than our artfully arranged atoms" --from a weirdly preachy letter admonishing someone about their comments on the original lamb in the Ghent Altarpiece. Preachy wrong person said a kind of dumb but kind of true thing? I don't know why it's here. It just struck me.]

###Thursday

I feel odd today. My mood has swung like a morningstar about to hit some unfortunate person in the face.

That's a really bad sentence. Just atrocious.

I started out well, then began working, and despaired. Rolling up survey results, providing "insights", worrying about inaccurate data... like being in a bog. Sinking.

Get on my phone and look at the group chat. My friends are dumb I feel unhinged and silly. Rom talking about Lupin/Sirius pairings being nicknamed "Wolfstar" makes me think of the star Betelgeuse.

"I wish for Betelgeuse to have exploded hundreds of years ago already."

Had some ramen, walked around the apartment impatiently. Maybe I should go to the coffeeshop.

(link-repeat:"Stray thoughts")[(display:"Modal code")(append:?modal)[
My writing is so bad but at least I feel freer to go with it.]

The ramen made me sick.

My classmates submitted their entries. I am eager to read. Finish and submit my own. I wonder in what special ways they'll judge me.

I'm aware I am self-deprecating and prone to complaint. And I was really extra by making a Twine game. I guess this can be my first entry for Decade Jam.

Everyone's entries have a theme--they're about something. They're doing something specific. Focused on one or a couple of topics. I'm not and my writing is poorer for it. I tried to come up with a different "thing."

I wondered what would express my me-ness better. I'm not a dancer. I'm not really an artist. I doodle every now and then.

I love dogs--I love my dogs, but I barely write about them (they figure heavily in my Instagram, though).

I love my boyfriend (and I have thought about scribbling a comic about our dumbest conversations and daily silliness), but I don't feel like dedicating all my creative output to my relationship.

I have been a barista, an interview transcriptionist, an elementary school tutor, nude art model, call center lackey, and I'm currently an Excel table maker, but none of those things feel like //me//.

(link-repeat:"Future topic brainstorm")[(display:"Modal code")(append:?modal)[
Talk about:
* Your nosiness. You used to be embarrassed by your mother's nosiness and now you are totally her, to your horror
* Parents in general
* The numbers you remember (like earth being 8 light-minutes from the sun, how much blood is in a human body...)
* Giant neutrino detectors like temples. Holy monuments to humanity]
